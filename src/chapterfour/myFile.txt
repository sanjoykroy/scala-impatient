Though north and west Bengal were part of the Magadhan empire southern Bengal thrived and became powerful with her overseas
trades. In 326 BCE, with the invasion of Alexander the Great the region again came to prominence. The Greek and Latin historians
suggested that Alexander the Great withdrew from India anticipating the valiant counter attack of the mighty Gangaridai empire that
was located in the Bengal region. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, Coenus, was convinced that it was better to return.
Diodorus Siculus mentions Gangaridai to be the most powerful empire in India whose king possessed an army of 20,000 horses, 200,000
infantry, 2,000 chariots and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war. The allied forces of Gangaridai Empire and Nanda Empire
(Prasii) were preparing a massive counter attack against the forces of Alexander on the banks of Ganges. Gangaridai, according to
the Greek accounts, kept on flourishing at least up to the 1st century AD.
